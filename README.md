# ðŸ“ˆ Time-Series Analysis and Forecasting for Stock Market

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to forecast stock prices based on the past 60 days of historical data. It includes an interactive Gradio interface for real-time predictions.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- **Model**: Deep learning using LSTM
- **Input**: Past 60 days of stock prices
- **Output**: Predicted future price(s)
- **Interface**: Gradio-based web UI
- **Data Source**: Apple stock market Finance

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Load and visualize historical stock data
- Preprocess data for time series modeling
- Train/test an LSTM model
- Predict the next day's stock price
- Host the app using Gradio
